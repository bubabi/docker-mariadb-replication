MariaDB standard master-slave replication and fail-over with Docker 

## Set up Replication 
#### On Master Server

```
./repel.sh --setup --master
```

#### On Slave Server 

```
./repel.sh --setup --slave <MASTER_IP>
```

Set-up is finished, you can test your replication by writing any data in the database.

## Switching roles between master-slave servers 

Make sure your tables are locked on master also make sure that no data is written to the master before the switching and follow the steps in order.

#### On Slave Server 

```
./repel.sh --switch to-master
```

#### On Master Server

```
./repel.sh --switch to-slave <SLAVE_IP>
```
The switch is completed and the data is transferred from the new master to the new slave.
